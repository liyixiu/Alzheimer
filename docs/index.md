# Project Description
**Classification of Alzheimer’s Disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment, and Cognitively-unimpaired Individuals using Machine Learning Algorithms and Regression models**

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia and is a complicated multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder. AD is an irreversible process that typically begins after 60 and there is no effective treatment for it right now. Previous studies showed there are around 40 million patients suffering from AD globally. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a transitional phase between healthy aging and AD, which indicates cognitive defects but can strongly affect the patient’s quality of life. The accurate diagnosis of AD, especially for its early stage (MCI) is very important for patients to get early treatment, which can mitigate the progression of AD. Recent studies found that MRI, PET imaging, and biomarkers, etc are sensitive in diagnosing AD and MCI. But it is expensive to get all these tests and the results are unintuitive for the general population. Some cognitive tests are easy to conduct while they are not sufficient for AD diagnosis. To detect AD in a cost-efficient manner, we proposed aims as below:

## Aim 1: 
Build a classification model using demographic information, neurological exams, screening labs, vital signs, cognitive assessments, biospecimen collections, medication, diagnosis summary, lumbar puncture, genetic, MRI, PET image, and biospecimen data, etc. to classify individual’s disease status (non-disease/control, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease). Logistic regression and machine learning classification algorithms (boosting, random forest, etc.) will be used to find the optimal model. 

## Aim 2: 
Find the most cost-efficient way with least amount covariates to classify people’s disease status.  Easiness of getting the information about certain covariate will be considered during the selection of covariates, as we want to maximize the economic efficiency.
